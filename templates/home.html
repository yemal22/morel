            <h2>Hello üëã, I'm Y√©malin</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Junior Data Scientist from Benin, driven by a passion for applying Artificial Intelligence
                and Big Data to solve real-world problems ‚Äî especially those relevant to African communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a solid academic background in both Mathematics and Information Technologies, I enjoy building
                innovative tools that enhance public health, food security, and digital transformation across Africa.
                I‚Äôve worked on projects involving computer vision, image captioning, and multimodal search systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that technology should not just be powerful ‚Äî it should be purposeful. That‚Äôs why my work
                always focuses on impact, culture, and accessibility.

        <h3>üìç My Mission</h3>
        <p>
            To empower African solutions through intelligent technologies ‚Äî bridging the gap between machine learning
            research and local societal needs. I envision AI systems that speak our languages, understand our foods, and
            see our cultures.
